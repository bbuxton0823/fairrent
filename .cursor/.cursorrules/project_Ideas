# Project Ideas

## Overview
The project involves building a comprehensive rent analysis app similar to GoSection8. The app will include features such as rent reasonableness, comparable data, map integration, rent laws/regulations, PDF generation, emailing, advanced AI chat/analysis, user authentication, roles, social logins, multi-tenant architecture, and subscription plans.

## Core Features
1. **Property Entry & Rent Analysis**: Collect property details and compare to local comps for a recommended rent.
2. **Local/State/Federal Rent Laws**: Store or reference rent caps and control rules, and display disclaimers.
3. **Maps**: Show subject property and nearby comps on an interactive map or embed a static map in the PDF.
4. **PDF Output & Email**: Generate summaries, disclaimers, and adjustments, and email the final PDF to users.
5. **AI Operator**: Summarize comps, provide disclaimers, and validate data using an LLM (OpenAI).
6. **Auth & Roles**: Implement landlord vs. admin roles, with optional super-admin or multi-tenant approach.
7. **Subscriptions**: Offer free (ad-supported), pro, and enterprise plans, possibly with usage-based billing via Stripe.

## Initial Setup
1. Create a new Next.js project:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app rent-analysis-app
   cd rent-analysis-app
Install dependencies:
npm install next react react-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer axios puppeteer nodemailer next-auth bcrypt jsonwebtoken openai react-map-gl mapbox-gl stripe
Initialize Tailwind (optional):
npx tailwindcss init -p
Basic Rent Analysis Flow

Property Input Form: Create a form with fields for address, beds, baths, sqft, etc.
API Route: Geocode address, fetch local comps, and calculate average rent.
Result: Display the recommended rent range on the front end.
Rent Laws & Regulations

Create a rentRegulations.json file to store local rules.
Adjust the recommended rent based on local rent control or caps.
Map Integration

Install Mapbox for interactive maps:
npm install react-map-gl mapbox-gl
Create a component to display the map with subject property and nearby comps.
PDF Generation & Emailing

Use Puppeteer or other libraries to generate PDFs.
Use Nodemailer to email the final PDF to users.
AI Operator

Integrate an LLM (OpenAI) to summarize comps, provide disclaimers, and validate data.
User Authentication & Roles

Implement social login (Google, Apple, Facebook) or email/password authentication.
Define roles for landlords and admins, with optional super-admin or multi-tenant approach.
Subscription Plans

Offer free, pro, and enterprise plans, possibly with usage-based billing via Stripe.
Putting It All Together

Organize the project files and folders according to the features and requirements.
Next Steps & Final Notes

Continue to refine and expand the app's features based on user feedback and requirements.
