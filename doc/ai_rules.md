# AI Integration Rules and Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the rules and guidelines for AI integration in the FairRent application. These rules ensure consistent, secure, and effective use of AI capabilities throughout the platform.

## Core AI Features

### 1. Rent Analysis AI
- Must analyze local market data to provide accurate rent estimates
- Should consider:
  - Property characteristics (size, bedrooms, bathrooms)
  - Location factors (neighborhood, amenities)
  - Market trends and seasonality
  - Comparable properties within a 1-mile radius
- Confidence score must be provided with each analysis

### 2. Data Validation AI
- Must validate user inputs for accuracy and completeness
- Should detect and flag:
  - Unrealistic property values
  - Inconsistent data entries
  - Missing critical information
- Provide specific feedback for correction

### 3. Summary Generation
- Must generate clear, concise property summaries
- Include:
  - Key property features
  - Market position
  - Competitive advantages
  - Potential concerns
- Use professional, unbiased language

### 4. Compliance Check
- Must verify compliance with:
  - Local rent control laws
  - Fair housing regulations
  - HUD guidelines
- Generate appropriate disclaimers

## AI Implementation Guidelines
